# fraux-bot
Fraux Bot for Discord using Python and discord.py (https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

This is a bot that is currently in development, developed solely by me (hoppiyoppi) as a curiosity.

Current features:
  - !helpme command to surmise the bot's functions
  - !bless command to wish you good luck for gacha rolls
  - !welcome command to give a short welcome message
  - responds to people saying hello to them
  - says a message at day reset time for Granblue Fantasy 
 
 
If you want to have this bot in your server, or have any other questions, message me on Discord at hoppiyoppi#1863.
